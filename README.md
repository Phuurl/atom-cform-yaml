# Usage
1. Create an empty ```*.yaml``` file and type ```start``` - a skeleton YAML CloudFormation template will appear.
2. Under each section begin typing the 'thing' you are trying to define, such as ```parameter```, ```output```, or ```ec2-instance```.  The package will populate the template for you.
3. Tab through the different fields and fill in your values.
4. Save the template and run it through the AWS CloudFormation console or deploy the template using the AWS CLI.
5. Have fun and get building!
